To do a full process of the data:

	1) Run Pickle_Data.py:
	   
	   This creates basic instances of pickle files, copying them to the 
	   data-procss directory. It skips over any pickle files which have already 
	   been created on the hopeful assumption that the basic format is stable 
	   enough not to change.
       
	2) Run Load_Raw_Data.py
	    
	   This converts those log files which have not yet been 
	   processed into .npy files for future reference and ease of access.
	   
	2) Run Smooth_Data.py: 
	   
	   This does basic noise removal from the data; in particular it removes 
	   the RF-spikes.
	   
	3) Run Combine_Data.py: 
	   
	   This will combine the data into a single signal, along with relavant 
	   frequency information. This set of routines is not yet complete.
	   
All data (except the .npy files in Load_Data) is written to the meta-pickle 
file in the data-process directory. As far as I have tested, nothing is 
modified in the data folder.

Details for the structure of the metadata pickle can be found in 
Data_Specification.txt. Additional files include:

  - Envelope_Functions.py: For detecting the envelope and removing RF noise.
  
  - Plotting_Wrappers.py: A set of plotting routines to make matplotlib less 
    aneurysm-inducing, now mainly useful for debugging, but will probably come 
	in handy for the report.
	
  - File_Managing_Functions: A set of wrappers for Pythons 'os' module which 
  	makes them slightly friendlier for our purposes.

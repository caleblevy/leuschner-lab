# Pickle structure originated by Aaron Tran and extended by Caleb Levy.

Specification for Data:

Structure of any pickle file processed by Load_Data, Smooth_Data, and 
Combine_Data (in that order). Combine_Data is a work in progress.

Data\
	b - Latitude
	f_high - High frequency LO
	f_low - Low frequency LO
	fname - File name
	grid - Where it is in our grid (?)
	l - Longitude
	n_cal - Number of calibration spectra taken in the averaging (?)
	n_obs - Number of observation spectra used in each averaging (?)
	rec_success - Was this point good
	time - Julian/unix/whatever friggin time (time.localtime())
	jd - Julian day (best friggin time)
	
	Tokens\
		made-np-data
		added-np-data-to-array
		smoothed-data
		
	Paths\
		dependencies-dir - location of log files
		backup-name - defunct for now
		save-name - full path name where pickle file will be saved
		save-prefix - for saving np files
		save-dir - full folder path containing where python pickle is saved
	
	Raw\
		left
		leftC - calibration
		right
		rightC
		right_Ax - frequency axis (to be likely corrected)
		left_Ax
		
	Smooth\ 
		left
		left_Ax - frequency axis
		left_inds - indices of the minimum data points used to construct the 
			        smoothed curve.
		left_power - normalization factor used for each spectra.
		right
		right_Ax
		right_inds
		right_power
		
	Combine\ -- Not yet in functioning form
		R_over_L - (very) rough ratio of left and right power
		lr_func - function to convert gridpoints via fitting (throwaway)
		left - Remnant of scipy interpolation
